Before compiling:
>> make clean

To compile:
>> make all

To run local test case and IoTNodeReqGen:
>> make testlocal

To run automated test case (Run this on net06, net07 and net08 at the same time.)
>> make testnet

To stop any instance of FogNode and IoTNodeReqGen:
>> make kill

To view test logs in gedit (this will open .log file for each node and IoTNodeReqGen.
If test are ran for a while opening log files in gedit may not be wise due to their size):
>> make log

To inspect a particular IoT node message in logs:
>> make inspect SEARCH="REPLACE_WITH_EXPRESSION_TO_SEARCH"

e.g. To inspect a particular IoT node request with sequence number 30 in logs:
>> make inspect SEARCH="Request{30}"

or short hand:
>> make inspect SEARCH="{30}"
